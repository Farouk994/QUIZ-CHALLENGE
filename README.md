# JAVASCRIPT

1. We create different variables with our Button Ids from the html page that we created and then link them to our javascript incase they are pressed or triggered to perfrom a given function.

2. Created variables for all of our questions and options and our correct answers listed in form of an object. 

3. Create last question index equal to the question.length-1 incase the array has more values in the string since array.length is equal to 4 and last element index is equal to 3 .

4. We create var for running question index, which is the question the user is answering and then set it equal to 0.

5. We create var for q with questions[runningQuestionIndex]; and insert in our inner HTML question choices

6. For the first question we will just set the running question index to '0' and then render the question and increment the next question index to ++ to show the user the user the next question.

7. I then decided to create a new function that shows when the user is right or wrong and an SFX will go on if the user is either right or wrong.

8. Counter render is then created with a question time of 10seconds for every question starting from a count of 0.

9. Function counter render will be called for every second and i placed in a condition for time for every question and increment count increment by 1 else if user doesnt answer the question the and the count is 0.

10. Please read in between the lines for javascript as i tried to explain all my code in details with how i managed to create this quiz with javascript
